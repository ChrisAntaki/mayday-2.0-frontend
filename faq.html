              This campaign will occur across at least two election cycles. We have launched an experiment to see whether we can kick-start a campaign for fundamental reform. With over $7,000,000 in donations, the first stage of that experiment has succeeded.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014, we will are launching independent campaigns in at least five congressional districts. Our goal: To elect five members of Congress who support strong reforms of the way candidates fund elections.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is just the pilot program, Based on what we learn in those 5 districts, we will launch a much larger campaign in 2016 to get us to 218 votes in the House, and 60 votes in the United States Senate.

              Mayday PAC was funded by two kick-started crowdfunding rounds. The first, in May, met it’s $1M goal in 13 days, and the second, from June 4th to midnight, Independence Day. We met that goal thanks to a great last-minute rally nine hours before the deadline. Over 50,000 citizens have contributed to the Mayday PAC, making it truly a citizen-funded PAC. So far as we know, no Super PAC has ever had more contributors.

              No, and in fact, during our crowdfunding rounds, we allowed our donors to earmark their contributions to help &#8220;Democrats Only,&#8221; &#8220;Republicans Only,&#8221; or &#8220;Whatever Helps.&#8221; The vast majority &#8212; between 70-80% &#8212; chose &#8220;Whatever Helps.&#8221; We’re not interested in pushing policies for the Left or the Right, but to free Congress to lead on issues that the Left and the Right care about.

              The Mayday PAC is a 501(4)(c), or “Super PAC.” That means that so long as the PAC is not seen as “coordinating” with any candidate or candidate’s committee, we can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the ultimate aim of this super PAC is to end the dominance of super PACs in our elections. We want fundamental reform that will change the way elections are funded. The first step towards that goal is to elect a Congress that will enact fundamental reform. Once we have elected that Congress, we will then consider the constitutional reform that will secure fundamental reform.

              Yes. We want to use big money (collected from the many) to fight big money (collected from the few). Ironic, we understand. But embrace the irony. Everyone recognizes that politics costs money in America. And we don’t imagine a future where campaigns are free. But if we can pull together a large enough pool of money through this campaign, we can convince Americans that they can change the way money matters in politics. We can create a system in which it isn’t the influence of a few that matters. Instead, as any democracy should, it would be the influence of a majority that matters.

              We will use the money to win elections in which we’ve made fundamental reform a key issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of this effort, we will hire professional campaigners who will craft interventions in targeted districts to make fundamental reform the issue in that campaign &#8212; and to make the reform candidate the winner.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014, these interventions will serve as prototype for a much larger round of funding in the 2016 cycle. Our aim this year is to learn what works, and to prepare for the much bigger fight in the next election for a majority in Congress committed to reform.
            </p>
            <p>
              100% of the money that came from our pledgers will be used to fund campaigns. Any expenses we have to build and operate the MaydayPAC &#8212; and there will be some &#8212; will be paid for through other donations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope you’ll give us the freedom to run the most effective campaign for fundamental reform that we can. But if you’d like to target your contributions, you can indicate whether your money will help only Republicans, or only Democrats.
