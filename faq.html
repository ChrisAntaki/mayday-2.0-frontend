                This campaign will occur across at least two election cycles. We have launched an experiment to see whether we can kick-start a campaign for fundamental reform. With over $7,000,000 in donations, the first stage of that experiment has succeeded.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2014, we will are launching independent campaigns in at least five congressional districts. Our goal: To elect five members of Congress who support strong reforms of the way candidates fund elections.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is just the pilot program, Based on what we learn in those 5 districts, we will launch a much larger campaign in 2016 to get us to 218 votes in the House, and 60 votes in the United States Senate.

                Mayday PAC was funded by two kick-started crowdfunding rounds. The first, in May, met it’s $1M goal in 13 days, and the second, from June 4th to midnight, Independence Day. We met that goal thanks to a great last-minute rally nine hours before the deadline. Over 50,000 citizens have contributed to the Mayday PAC, making it truly a citizen-funded PAC. So far as we know, no Super PAC has ever had more contributors.

                No, and in fact, during our crowdfunding rounds, we allowed our donors to earmark their contributions to help &#8220;Democrats Only,&#8221; &#8220;Republicans Only,&#8221; or &#8220;Whatever Helps.&#8221; The vast majority &#8212; between 70-80% &#8212; chose &#8220;Whatever Helps.&#8221; We’re not interested in pushing policies for the Left or the Right, but to free Congress to lead on issues that the Left and the Right care about.

                The Mayday PAC is a 501(4)(c), or “Super PAC.” That means that so long as the PAC is not seen as “coordinating” with any candidate or candidate’s committee, we can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the ultimate aim of this super PAC is to end the dominance of super PACs in our elections. We want fundamental reform that will change the way elections are funded. The first step towards that goal is to elect a Congress that will enact fundamental reform. Once we have elected that Congress, we will then consider the constitutional reform that will secure fundamental reform.

                Yes. We want to use big money (collected from the many) to fight big money (collected from the few). Ironic, we understand. But embrace the irony. Everyone recognizes that politics costs money in America. And we don’t imagine a future where campaigns are free. But if we can pull together a large enough pool of money through this campaign, we can convince Americans that they can change the way money matters in politics. We can create a system in which it isn’t the influence of a few that matters. Instead, as any democracy should, it would be the influence of a majority that matters.

                We will use the money to win elections in which we’ve made fundamental reform a key issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this effort, we will hire professional campaigners who will craft interventions in targeted districts to make fundamental reform the issue in that campaign &#8212; and to make the reform candidate the winner.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2014, these interventions will serve as prototype for a much larger round of funding in the 2016 cycle. Our aim this year is to learn what works, and to prepare for the much bigger fight in the next election for a majority in Congress committed to reform.
              </p>
              <p>
                100% of the money that came from our pledgers will be used to fund campaigns. Any expenses we have to build and operate the MaydayPAC &#8212; and there will be some &#8212; will be paid for through other donations.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hope you’ll give us the freedom to run the most effective campaign for fundamental reform that we can. But if you’d like to target your contributions, you can indicate whether your money will help only Republicans, or only Democrats.

              <p>
                There are a range of proposals that would do this &#8212; some better than others, but all which would achieve fundamental reform. Lawrence Lessig’s campaign finance reform group Rootstrikers has listed five specific proposals at <a>reform.to</a>, and that list may evolve.
              </p>
              <p>
                But as a first step, any candidate for Congress who has pledged to co-sponsor one of these reforms will be safe from the Mayday PAC. At this point, we will only target candidates who have not already committed to co-sponsoring fundamental reform.
              </p>
              <p>
                That standard may change. The requirements for &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; may need to evolve. But at this point, the simplest way for a candidate or incumbent to avoid the Mayday PAC is to commit to fundamental reform.

                The work of the Mayday PAC will not be finished until we have secured constitutional reform. But that change is next on the list. It is not the focus of our work now. And we do not view a commitment to constitutional reform without a commitment to statutory reform as sufficient.

                Yes. Support for fundamental reform in the way campaigns are funded is the essential filter now. There will always be issues that we, as individuals, will feel passionate about. But the one and only thing that our pledgers and volunteers are unanimously united on is the need to reform the way we fund elections in the United States.

                In 2014, we will spend the money to learn and to teach &#8212; to learn what works best, in winning seats on the basis of reform, and to teach that this is an issue all Americans care about, whether Democrats, Republicans, or Independents. That should make the candidates in 2016 at all levels of government pay attention.
              </p>
              <p>
                That campaign will be most effective when it can launch fully and effectively. If we pre-launch it &#8212; by announcing candidates now &#8212; it will not be effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2016, we will spend money to win a majority in Congress committed to fundamental reform.

                In 2014, our objective is to win seats on the basis of reform, and to show that we can win seats on the basis of reform. We don’t see any independent candidates on the federal level who could win this election cycle. Spending our donors money to support independent candidates doesn’t advance our objective. However, if that changes, we will reconsider.

                <strong>None of the money raised through this citizens-up campaign will be spent for overhead or other indirect costs. 100% of that money will be devoted to campaigns.</strong>

                This doesn’t mean there is no overhead in this project. It means we will cover the costs of that overhead — including even the payment processing fees from your contributions — from other sources. Those costs will be as small as we can keep them. None of the directors of the Mayday PAC will be paid. And we will keep the costs of building and maintaining Mayday.us as low as possible. But whatever costs this organizing site incurs, we will cover them independently of the money raised through the two pledge campaigns.

                We have decided upon using Stripe as our payment processor. Stripe has offered us a very competitive rate (for which we thank them), and Stripe is compliant with PCI requirements and no sensitive data hits our servers. When you enter in your credit card information, it is not stored on the Mayday.us site and goes directly to Stripe via the Stripe.js API.
              </p>
              <p>
                Or in short: Yes, your money and info are safe.
