      <h1><strong>About</strong> Mayday</h1>
      <p class='aboutBlurb'>
        Mayday is a movement of citizens dedicated to passing fundamental reform to end the system of corruption in Washington, D.C. Our goal is to create a sufficient incentive to motivate a majority in Congress to pass fundamental reform in the way we fund our political campaigns.

      <p>In 2014, Mayday debuted as the Super PAC to end Super PACs. We crowdfunded over $6,000,000 from over 68,000 people. In the four biggest races we entered, our efforts were a significant tax on our opponent, forcing him to spend significantly to neutralize the effect of our campaign. This experience taught us important lessons about the most effective ways to pressure members of Congress. We are bringing that same experimental, data-driven spirit to our new campaign.</p>

      <p>With our new plan to activate voters directly rather than rely on costly ad campaigns, the threat to anti-reform incumbents is even greater. Mayday will leverage the skills, ideas, and power of our community to win this fight. We are counting on your energy and ideas to make this campaign a success, so please get involved and <a href="/take_action">take action to pass reform</a>.</p>
