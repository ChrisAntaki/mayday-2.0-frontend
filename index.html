        <h2>Mayday v2 begins now</h2>
        <p>In 2014, we rallied more than 50,000 Americans to support a fight for fundamental reform in the way campaigns are funded &mdash; to reduce the influence of money in politics, by increasing the influence of people in politics.</p>
        <p>But in the campaigns, we didn’t move the ball far enough.</p>
        <p>So in 2015, we’re doing something different. To prove that reform is possible, we need to close the gap on a majority in Congress &mdash; both Republicans and Democrats &mdash; committed to reforming the system of corruption in Washington, D.C., by changing the way campaigns are funded.</p>

        <p>We need you to help us identify who our allies should be. <a class="show-nomination-modal">Tell us who you think we could persuade, and why</a>.</p>
        <p>We’re looking for leaders who understand that the way campaigns are funded is broken. You can see a list of Members who have committed to <a href"http://www.repswith.us">fundamental reform here.</a> Who else should be on that list? </p>

        <h2>Our techniques are experimental</h2>
        <p>As our campaign evolves, we’ll measure how representatives respond. We’ll double-down on what works and let go of what doesn’t. We’ll get smarter as we go. Our data-driven campaign has no place for ideological blinders. Mayday is in it to win it.</p>

        <h2>
          This starts with you
        </h2>
        <p>
          On May 1 &mdash; May Day &mdash; we will launch a platform to support the biggest citizen lobbying campaign we possibly can. Together, we are strong enough to create the political incentive for our elected officials to do the right thing and support reform. Ending the systemic corruption in Washington, D.C., will create space for fair, honest, and productive debate on the issues that matter most.
        </p>
        <p>We can only get our democracy back if we work together. As an early supporter of Mayday, you can help us make our launch the best it can be. <a class="show-nomination-modal">Let us know how you want to be involved and who you think we should target.</a></p>
