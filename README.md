# mayday-2.0-frontend
Placeholder for 2015 front-end

## Getting started.

This site is build with Jekyll, so you'll need that on your computer to hack on the code.  If you don't already have ruby installed, I recommend installing it with RVM.  Then install jekyll `game install jekyll`.
Finally, to run it locally just run `jekyll serve --watch`, it'll update when you change the code.



## Code Review Process

Goal: Ensure at least two parties have reviewed any code commited for "production."

### Process:
1. Branch off any new feature development 
2. Regularly commit to your branch.
3. When code is ready to be merged, create merge request.  Merge request should be able to be merged by github and all/any tests should be passing.
4. Assign another developer to review your merge request.
5. Merge request is reviewed and made on github.
